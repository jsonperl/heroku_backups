Rake tasks for backing up and restoring your Heroku Postgres databases to Amazon S3. You can use it to run a nightly backup cron, or to transfer between environments. 

Setup:
1) Add the aws-s3 gem to your Gemfile
gem 'aws-s3'

2) Edit the backups.rake and fill in these required values.  If the bucket doesn't yet exist, it will create it.  Keep in mind buckets must be globally unique, so pick something specific (my-sweet-app-backups). Ideally these settings will come from a config file, I like to use SettingsLogic (https://github.com/binarylogic/settingslogic).
BACKUP_BUCKET = '<your backup bucket>'
ACCESS_KEY_ID = '<your aws access key id>'
SECRET_KEY    = '<your aws secret key>'

Usage:
a) You can put it in your cronfile like so
desc "Cron fights for the users"
task :cron => :environment do
  Rake::Task['backups:snapshot'].invoke if Time.now.hour == 2 # runs at 2am
end

b) And/or you can call the tasks manually
heroku rake backups:snapshot --app from_application
heroku rake backup:restore --app to_application
heroku rake backup:restore filename=bkp.1273533572.tar.gz --app to_application

c) Restore locally from remote backup!
rake backup:restore filename=bkp.1273533572.tar.gz

Notes: 
* By default the restore will grab the latest backup that resides in the bucket out on s3.  To specify a specific point in time backup, simply add a "filename=bkp.yourfilename.tar.gz" to the task.
ex: heroku rake db:restore filename=bkp.1273533572.tar.gz --app to_application

Oh and thanks a ton to Nick Merwin for getting me rolling!
