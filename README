These rake tasks are basically a cleaned up and consolidated version of everything good I could find related to backup of heroku databases.  It essentially takes advantage of pg_dump and pg_restore capailities of postgres.

You can use it to run a nightly backup cron, or to transfer between environments. 

heroku rake db:backup --app from_application
heroku rake db:restore --app to_application

Notes: 
* You'll need to place your backup bucket name where it indicates in database.rake
* You will need aws_s3 since we're dumping a pg_dump compressed backup
* By default the restore will grab the latest backup that resides in the bucket out on s3.  To specify a specific point in time backup, simply add a "filename=bkp.yourfilename.tar.gz" to the task.
ex: heroku rake db:restore filename=bkp.1273533572.tar.gz --app to_application

Hope this helps some folks.

Oh and thanks a ton to Nick Merwin for getting me rolling!
